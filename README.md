"During the year, I took on additional responsibilities to support the team while a colleague was on paternity leave. I’m proud to have been able to ensure continuity, maintain our quality standards, and meet our deadlines, even with an increased workload. This experience allowed me to further develop my project management skills, enhance my time management, and strengthen cross-functional collaboration. It was a valuable opportunity to contribute to the team’s success and demonstrate flexibility in meeting our goals."
